                Koyambedu is a neighbourhood in Chennai, India. Situated in the western part of Chennai city, the Koyambedu area has become a major hub of activity in Chennai after the inauguration of the Koyambedu market in 1996 and the Chennai Mofussil Bus Terminus (CMBT) in 2002. The area is active round the clock owing to the movement of people and goods through the day, with uninterrupted transport facilities such as long-route buses, autos, share autos, vegetable goods carriers and so forth.
